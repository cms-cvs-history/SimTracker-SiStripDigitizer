In order to run with the SiStripDigitizer package in this version, you need to do the following:

setenv  Magfield_PATH /afs/cern.ch/cms/Releases/Geometry/Geometry_1_23_0/src/Data/FieldTables/
setenv CMSSW_DATA_PATH scratch0/CMSSW_0_3_0_pre2/src/

In order to avoid unnecessary replicas of the same file, the runStripDigi.txt configuration file calls an xml file from inside the SimTracker/SiPixelDigitizer package.
So checkout SimTracker/SiPixelDigitizer (with no need to compile it).

This xml file points to several files in the Geometry subsystem. So checkout Geometry, and again there is no need to compile it.

At present, you also need to checkout the latest version of DataFormats/SiStripDigi (and in this case you need to compile it!) otherwise you will have a crash when the program tries to push the digi collection inside the output root file.
